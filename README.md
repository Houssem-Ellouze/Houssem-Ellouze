👋 Hi, I’m @Houssem-Ellouze
👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering
🌱 I’m currently learning about full-stack development with Angular and Spring Boot, machine learning, and more.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to web development, machine learning integration, and system architecture.
⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy transforming complex problems into efficient and scalable solutions, and I love tackling challenges in both front-end and back-end development
